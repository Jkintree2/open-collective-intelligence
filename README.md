## Description
Perhap the highest priority for humanity is to build an open source, decentralized, privacy protecting, and fact checking global platform that can merge the knowledge and sentiment expressed in public conversations with billions of people around the world. This github project is for a demonstration of concept of this collective human and digital intelligence.

### Components
Components could include an app, a website, or a phone number at the front end, a language model in the middle, and a vector and graph database such as Neo4j in the back end. A fusion of the Neo4j LLM Knowledge Graph Builder, the Zep Graphiti knowledge graph engine, and the Mem0 memory for conversations could serve as a starting point for a demonstration of concept. 

Running small language models (SLMs) on smartphones can yield a 10x reduction in electricity usage compared with running LLMs in data centers. Making the platform accessible by phones could reach 90% of humanity. 

Multilingual text embedding models could create indexes of topics and proposals discussed in local to global deliberations. There are embedding models that are small enough to run on smartphones. 
### Features
* The language model would extract knowledge and sentiment from selected parts of public conversations to merge into a shared vector and graph representation.
* The platform, with humans in the loop, would continuously fact check statements merged into the shared graph.
* The platform would report which issues are discussed by the most people, the sentiment expressed on proposed solutions, and show how this sentiment changes over time.
* The platform would classify, from the local to the global level, the jurisdictions to which the issues relate.
### Outcomes
After the demonstration of concept, the platform could be scaled to merge the knowledge and sentiment expressed in millions of simultaneous conversations with people around the world, becoming a form of collective terrestrial intelligence, CTI. The prompt.txt file in this project is a draft set of instructions to a language model for constructing a knowledge graph of people, claims, evidence, proposals, and sentiment about proposals.

This would enable citizens to vote directly for principles and policies from the local to the global level. 
### Commissions
A commission of $10,000 can be paid to help materialize this concept.
