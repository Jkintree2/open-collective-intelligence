## Description
Perhap the highest priority for humanity now is to build a conversational open source and decentralized global computer platform for collective human and digital intelligence.
This github project is for a demonstration of concept.
### Components
Components could include a public facing web server, a language model adapted to act as an interface to databases in the middle, and a vector and graph database such as Neo4j in the back end. The Neo4j LLM Knowledge Graph Builder could serve as a starting point for a demonstration of concept.
### Features
* The platform would have methods to authenticate the identities of users, and to allow users to share parts of conversations anonymously.
* The language model would extract entities and relationships from selected parts of public conversations to merge into a shared vector and graph representation.
* The platform would continuously fact check statements merged into the shared graph.
* The platform would report which issues are discussed by the most people, the sentiment expressed on proposed solutions, and show how this sentiment changes over time.
### Outcome
After the demonstration of concept, the platform could be scaled to merge the knowledge and sentiment expressed in millions of simultaneous conversations with people around the world, becoming a form of global collective intelligence.
### Commissions
Commissions of $1,000 can be paid to people who help develop this demonstration of concept.
